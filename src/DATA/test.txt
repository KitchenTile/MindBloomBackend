Chapter 1: The Foundations of RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is an AI framework that improves the accuracy and reliability of large language models. It works by providing an LLM with relevant, external data before generating a response. This process is crucial for preventing the model from hallucinating or fabricating information.

The RAG architecture has two main phases: data ingestion and retrieval-and-generation. The ingestion phase, which we are building, is an offline process where source documents are prepared for search. This involves loading, chunking, embedding, and storing the data.

Chapter 2: The Importance of Embeddings

Embeddings are numerical representations of text. They are high-dimensional vectors where the distance between vectors corresponds to the semantic similarity of the text. This means that text with similar meanings will have embeddings that are close to each other in vector space.

Generating embeddings is a critical step in the RAG pipeline. It allows the system to perform a semantic search, where the user's query is also converted to an embedding. The system can then find the most relevant document chunks by calculating the similarity between the query embedding and the stored chunk embeddings.

Chapter 3: Storing Data in a Vector Database

To perform the semantic search, the embeddings must be stored in a specialized database that can handle and query vectors efficiently. Supabase, with its `pgvector` extension, is a perfect example of such a database.

When a new book is added, its metadata is stored in one table, and its chunks and their embeddings are stored in a separate table. The `book_id` serves as a foreign key, linking each chunk to its original source. This structured approach ensures data integrity and supports efficient retrieval.
